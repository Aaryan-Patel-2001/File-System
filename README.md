# File-System
This project implements File-System on a x86_64 architecture using C programming, originally developed on a Linux Enviornment. 
File System supports open, close, read and write operations. 
Functionality is tested by running unit tests on several workloads 
A fully associative cache improves the response time by 87% for some of the workloads.
